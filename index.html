            <img src="./pictures/new_profile.png" alt="picture of me">
            <p class="aboutme_text"> Greetings 👋...My name is James Reeves and I'm a web developer. I'm a family man with a wife and two children. On my free time I like to play videogames with my family (yes we are a gaming family 🎮) and going on outtings and events. We may go to a park, watch a movie, have a family BBQ, or grab a bite to eat at a restauraunt. I've also picked back up on sketching, playing chess, and boxing. <br>
                 I chose to get into development because of the creative aspect of being able to bring my thoughts and ideas to life. My previous profession was carpentry, and as a union carpenter, its a very rewarding feeling when you come together with a team and build something amazing. At the end of a project, you step back and look at the finish product with a sense of pride and accomplishment; like "yea, I did that, I was apart of bringing something great to life." Web development allows me to the exact same thing, the only difference is that im doing it digitally instead of physically (and in the comfort of my own home, not being in the elements and traffic 😆). Like construction, coding is another skill that I can past down to my children and provide for my family. <br>
                 My primary intention in web development is to secure a stable, long-term position where I can not only contribute to the company's growth but also invest in the growth of others. I am seeking a positive and collaborative work environment where I can thrive and learn, as stability and culture are top priorities for me. Furthermore, I am deeply committed to giving back to the community; I intend to actively use my experience to teach and mentor others in coding, ensuring knowledge is shared and the next generation of developers is prepared and supported.
